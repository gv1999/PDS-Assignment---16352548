The Principles of Data Science (PDS) course holds a paramount position in my academic journey as a dedicated Data Science student and enthusiast. Undertaken during my pursuit of a Master's degree in Data Science at the University of Missouri-Kansas City (UMKC), this course provided an extensive exploration of fundamental concepts, methodologies, and tools essential in the realm of data science.

Covering a wide array of topics including data manipulation, visualization, statistical analysis, machine learning, and data mining, PDS offered a comprehensive understanding of key principles vital for proficiency in the field.

In this repository, I have curated a collection of assignments from the Principles of Data Science course. These assignments serve as invaluable resources for practical application and reinforcement of theoretical knowledge.
